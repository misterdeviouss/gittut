Branching
A seperate version of the code being used to create and test new features. It is like a seperate timeline.
As a standard practice, we never directly change the master branch. We build features in a branch and then merge it with the master branch.
On the remote repo (github), your branch resides as upstream branch

git push --set-upstream origin hiteshbranch

HEAD: The pointer to the current branch where the commits will be made

git checkout -b branchname OR git branch branchname
creates a new branch. Checkout directly moves you to the branch.

git branch -d branchname
delete a branch

git checkout branchname
switch to the branch

git merge branchname
merge branchname's changes into the current branch
To merge into master, switch to master and git merge branchname
