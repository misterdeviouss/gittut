Branching
A seperate version of the code being used to create and test new features
As a standard practice, we never directly change the master branch

HEAD: The pointer to the current branch where the commits will be made

git checkout -b <<branchname>>
creates a new branch

git checkout <<branchname>>
switch to the branch

git merge <<branchname>>
merge <<branchname's>> changes into the current branch
