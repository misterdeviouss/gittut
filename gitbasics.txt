Git is a version control system
Github is an online website that allows us to host git repositories

Use cases of git:
1. Tracking changes of your respositories
2. Participating in open source contribs

git init
initializes a git repository and creates .git hidden folder (dir /A or ls -a)

git status
Displays what changes took place and what untracked files are present in the current repository

Untracked files: Files that are currently not been tracked by git in the current repository
Modified files: Tracked files that have new changes that are not committed
Staging area: Area where files are kept when ready to be committed.

Changing a file in staging area file will put a copy of it out of staging area where the changes
are present as a "modified" file

git add . or git add <<filename>>
adds untracked file or its changes to the staging area for comitting

git restore
reverts the changes on the modified file to the previous commit
