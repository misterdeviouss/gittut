Forking
Create a git repository by copying another git repository for own use
This is usually done when you cannot clone another orgnz/person's git repo and want to suggest changes to it
You can git clone this now since it is added to your account
See image for workflow

Pull request
When you fork a git project and make some changes to it, you would wanna get those changes
to the upstream branch. For that, you make a "pull request" to the developer so that
your changes enter the upstream branch.

Fork the codebase from github.

Do your contribution in a branch. Push it to github. Now compare and pull request.
Make a very good message and description. Impress the OG developer with your request.
